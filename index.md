## About Me

> I am now a Postdoc of I.N.A.F-Merate, Italy, collaborated with Dr. Gabriele Ponti.
> Before that I got my PhD at  Nanjing University under the supervision of Prof. Zhiyuan Li (2019-2024). Before that, I achieved the B.S. degree from Nanjing University.
> My research interest primarily lie in the X-ray population in globular clusters and the Galactic center. The main research is carried out in periodic variations of X-ray sources, such as X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables. 
Using their periodicity as the tracer, I study effects of cluster environment on formation and evolution of close binaries and more importantly, the origin of nuclear star cluster and the link to Globular clusters.
Besides, I also work on the time-varying characteristic of active galactic nuclei, such as the (quasi-) periodic oscillations and eruptions.

## Research Interests
*  Stellar populations and dynamics in Globular clusters

*  Periodic variations of X-ray binaries (black hole/neutron star binaries, cataclysmic variables, etc)

*  Quasi-periodic oscillations/eruptions of AGNs

*  Origins and X-ray populations of nuclear star clusters in the Galactic center
