## About Me

> I am a fifth-year (final year) PhD. candidate at  Nanjing University under the supervision of Prof. Zhiyuan Li (2019-2024 expected). Before that, I achieved the B.S. degree from Nanjing University.
>
> 
>
> My research interest primarily lie in the (quasi-) **periodic variations** of X-ray sources, such as X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, AGNs. I look for the time-varying characteristics of these objects and study their populations through X-ray observations. I am also interested in **stellar dynamics in dense envrionments** (e.g., Globular clusters). I study effects of cluster environment on formation and evolution of close binaries based on observational evidence.

> In addition to astrophysical research, I am also interested in development and deployment of methods in data-intensive research, particularly in the time domains.

## Research Interests
*  Periodic variations of X-ray sources (X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, etc) 

*  Quasi-periodic oscillations/eruptions of AGNs

*  Stellar dynamics in dense environments
