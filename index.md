## About Me

> I am a fifth-year (final year) PhD. candidate at  Nanjing University under the supervision of Prof. Zhiyuan Li (2019-2024 expected). Before that, I achieved the B.S. degree from Nanjing University.
> My research interest primarily lie in the X-ray population in globular clusters and the Galactic center. The main research is carried out in periodic variations of X-ray sources, such as X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables. 
Using their periodicity as the tracer, I study effects of cluster environment on formation and evolution of close binaries and more importantly, the origin of nuclear star cluster and the link to Globular clusters.
Besides, I also work on the time-varying characteristic of active galactic nuclei, such as the (quasi-) periodic oscillations and eruptions.

## Research Interests
*  Periodic variations of X-ray sources (X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, etc)
