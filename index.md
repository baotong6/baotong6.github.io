## About me

> I am a fifth-year (final year) PhD. candidate at  Nanjing University under the supervision of Prof. Zhiyuan Li (2019-2024 expected). Before that, I achieved the B.S. degree from Nanjing University.

> My research interest primarily lie in the (quasi-) periodic variations of X-ray sources, such as X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, AGNs. I look for the time-varying characteristics of these objects and study their populations through X-ray observations. I am also interested in stellar dynamics in dense envrionments (e.g., Globular clusters). I study effects of cluster environment on formation and evolution of close binaries based on observational evidence.

> In addition to astrophysical research, I am also interested in development and deployment of methods in data-intensive research, particularly in the time domains.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
